## Flappy times ahoy!
---
It's like that helicopter game that spawned a popular clone, which somehow made a ton of coin.

Playable, usually: [on glitch](https://wirehaired-gallimimus.glitch.me/flap.html)
Alternatively:
clone the repo
```
npm i
npm test
# or npm run testDull if nyancat isn't your cuppa
npm run build
npm start
```
http-server should serve it up on localhost.

## Refactoring, History, etc
---
If I recall correctly, this was hastily assembled within the free time of a day or two. Built from the skeleton of a previous game, with plenty of irrelevant flesh still hanging on. I'm in the process of updating it a bit, but honestly it would be more sensible to start from scratch. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


## Documentation
-------------
Improving the jsdoc comments as I update things. There isn't currently an html version of those docs built.
